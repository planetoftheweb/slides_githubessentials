Git gives you a lot of freedom to experiment with your code and one of the features that can really help is showing differences or diffs between files.

Say you make a change to a file and want to compare that to the last commit. You can issue a `git diff` command.

```sh
git diff
```

You'll get a report of the differences between the current state modifications and the files in the working state.

## Using Visual Studio Code

This is a place where your editor might be able to help. Visual Studio Code has a built in diff feature that makes diffing easier.

## Diffing Other Files

Diff is pretty flexible. You can use it to compare all types of things. So, for example, you can compare a file to it's state at any of your other commits. When comparing history, you'll often check the log to see what the changes were. When your logs get longer, there's a real useful option for git log called `--oneline`.

```sh
git log --oneline
```

You'll get a list of the commits in a single line.

```sh
c815dda (HEAD -> main) Added license and readme
aea989a First Commit
```

This will list the changes from the other commit. Diffing will get even more useful when you compare against different branches.

And of course, then you can unstage them and discard them.
