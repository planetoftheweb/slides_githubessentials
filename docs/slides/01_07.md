# Changing History

> >

It's good to think of what you're doing with Git as documenting the history of your project and like I mentioned in the intro, unlike most historians, your time machine lets you change the history. Let's take a look at some ways we can do that.

---

# Amending

```sh
git commit -amend
# git commit -am 'New commit message'
# git commit -amend --no-edit
```

> >

You can often end up committing something that's not quite right. You can create a new commit, but that ends up creating a messy history with a commit just for a fix. To add things to the last commit, you can use the `--amend` flag.

Let's change something about our project and then commit it using the ammend flag. I noticed that I'm using the text-uppercase class in several spots in this section of the page.

```html
<a class="navbar-brand text-uppercase" href="#page-hero"
  ><a class="navbar-brand text-uppercase" href="index.html">Layout</a>
  <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="myTogglerNav">
    <div class="navbar-nav ml-auto font-weight-regular text-uppercase">
      <a class="nav-item nav-link text-white" href="index.html">home</a>
      <a class="nav-item nav-link" href="columns.html">columns</a>
      <a class="nav-item nav-link" href="media.html">media</a>
    </div>
  </div></a
>
```

It would be more economical to make this change on the nav tag

```html
<nav class="site-nav family-sans navbar navbar-expand-md bg-dark navbar-dark **text-uppercase**"></nav>
```

Let's commit that change.

The problem is that I should have done that to all of the html files, not just the index. Let's fix that.

We'll copy lines 18-33 in the `index.html` file and paste them into the other files.

```html
<nav class="site-nav family-sans navbar navbar-expand-md bg-dark navbar-dark text-uppercase">
  <div class="container-fluid">
    <button
      type="button"
      class="navbar-toggler"
      data-toggle="collapse"
      data-target="#myTogglerNav"
      aria-controls="myTogglerNav"
      aria-label="Toggle Navigation"
    >
      <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
    </button>

    <a class="navbar-brand" href="#page-hero"
      ><a class="navbar-brand" href="index.html">Layout</a>
      <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="myTogglerNav">
        <div class="navbar-nav ml-auto font-weight-regular"></div></div
    ></a>
  </div>
</nav>
```

Now instead of doing a new commit.

```sh
git add .
git commit --amend
# git commit --amend -m 'Change commit message'
# git commit --amend --no-edit
```

When you run the ammend command, the default editor for your machine will run to give you an opportunity to change the commit message.

For some reason, I'm always trying to spell amend with two m's, so watch out for that.

```sh
git add columns.html
git commit --amend # then 'Fixed text-uppercase in nav on pages'
git add media.html
git commit --amend -m "Fixed text-uppercase in nav on all pages"
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

If you don't want to change the commit message, you can add the --no-edit option and it will just use the last message.

---

# Reset

Resetting lets you go backwards to a previous commit. Think of it as a rewind feature. We can do this by using the hashtags from the log. Lets' try rewinding to the last commit.

```sh
git log
git reset ID
# git reset --hard ID
```

This rewinds the tape, but it's what it's known as a soft reset. It doesn't remove the files that were committed. There's an option to do that as well, but be very careful because this is destructive and you won't be able to get files back after a hard reset.

---

# Rebasing

```sh
git rebase <branch>/<commit>
#git rebase --interactive <branch>/<commit>
# git rebase -i HEAD~#
# git rebase -i --root
```

> >

You may notice that it expects a branch name. Normally, rebase is designed to take the commits from one branch and apply them to another.

There's a useful interactive command that will let you use your text editor to make changes. This is the best way to user rebase.

Instead of a branch, you can use the HEAD pointer to modify the current branch's history. You can ask for a number of commits since the current commit to reorganize.

So, for example, let's say that after you've done a few commits, you realize that there's something you should have done earlier. Let's say that I should have modified the license so it had a company name.

```sh
- Copyright © 2021 Ray Villalobos
+ Copyright © 2021 LinkedIn
```

Let's go ahead and make the change, then add and commit the file.

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Fixed the license"
```

Let's try the rebase command.

```sh
git rebase HEAD~3
```

This will let you reorder the last three commits, but if you want to reorder everything you can use the root option. This will work for our case, but you might be working with a project that has much more commits, so the HEAD option is sometimes best.

```sh
git rebase -i --root
```

We have a ton of options here and I'm not going to discuss all of them since you can see the explanations. Basically, pick leaves the commits alone. You can move each line to switch the order of commits and you can control if the commits are squashed or not.
