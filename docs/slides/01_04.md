# Why Ignore Files?

- Sensitive info
- Personal notes
- System files

Git is great at tracking files, but you don't always want to track everything.
You could have some files with passwords or other sensitive information that you don't want to share with others. That could be authentication tokens, API keys, etc.

Ignored files aren't uploaded to GitHub, so this is a way to add notes you don't need to share with others, so for example a place to keep to-do items.

Operating systems and applications can have settings that you don't need to share. Mac OS, for example keeps a special file called `.DS_Store` file on most folders to keep track of files. Visual Studio Code can save a list of local preferences in a `.vscode` folder.

# Using .gitignore

```sh
.DS_Store
.vscode/
authentication.js
node_modules
notes/
**/*-todo.md
```

To take care of ignoring files, you can create a `.gitignore` file at the root level of your project. Inside that file, you can add any type of file or pattern that you want to ignore.

You can add an entry for the .DS_Store file as well as the .VSCode folder.

Another common one is a file called `node_modules`. This is create by npm when working on web projects.

If your project requires it, you can add a file here to store authentication tokens, API keys, etc.

You can also add a `notes/` folder here for local notes about the project you don't want to share.

Or you can create a special extension and add the notes anywhere in your project.

# Global Ignore File

```
git config --global core.excludesfile [file]
```

If you're going to be using the same ignore files in many projects, you can also add this as a config variable pointing to a file in your hard drive. You can add many things to your config variables that makes using git easier.

# Clearing the cache

```
git rm -r --cached .
```

One of the reasons I wanted to talk about the gitignore file this early, is that modifying it later on in your project can create an issue with the way git stores it's information. If you add some information that you've added to your gitconfigure document later on in the project, it's a good idea to run this command on your terminal to clear the cache.
