# Syncing GitHub

> >

Let's talk about the different ways we can synchronize what's on Github with our local hard drive.

---

# Clone

```sh
git clone URL
```

> >

Git clone will take the copy of the GitHub repository and place it on your local hard drive.

---

# Fetch

```sh
git fetch
```

> >

Fetch downloads information from your remote repository to bring you local repo up to date. Fetch doesn't actually do anything with that information, but it synchronizes your local folder with your remote.

---

# Pull

```sh
git pull
```

> >

Pull is a combination of doing a fetch, but also merging the data that is in your remote with the local version.
