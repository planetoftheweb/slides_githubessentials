# Sass Syntax

- `.sass` (Indented)
- No Punctuation
- Meaningful Whitespace

```sass
$bg: #ead2a8

body
  background: $bg
```

- `.scss` (CSS-like)

There are in fact two different flavors of SASS. The older format has a .sass extension.

This format gets rid of a lot of the punctuation in sass, so some people consider it an easier way to write sass.

The key thing about this format is that whitespace is meaningful, so you end up indenting with tabs or spaces whenever you'd type in curly braces.

You also don't need the ending semicolons.

# Sass Syntax

- CSS Compatible
- Most Popular

```scss

body {
  background: $bg;
}
```

- `.scss` (CSS-like)

The second format is the most popular and is fully compatible with CSS. All valid CSS is valid SCSS as well.

We'll be focusing on the scss format on this course.
