# Maps

> >

Your lists can get pretty complicated when you're working with values within values, so SASS provides the concepts of Maps.

---

# Map Basics

- `(<key_exp>: <val_exp>, ...)`
- Keys unique
- `@use "sass:map";`
- Immutable

```
@use "sass:map";
$colorList: (
  "primary": RoyalBlue,
  // ...
  );

/* map.get($colorList.primary) */;
```

Maps are designed to hold key value pairs common in programming language.

The keys have to be unique, also, it's a good idea to use quotes because SASS can interpret unquoted strings as different value types.

Maps aren't an automatically included module, so you may have to use the @use at rule to include them into your project.

Just like with lists, maps are immutable, but you often need to modify a map, so you can feed the results of a map operation to the same variable.
